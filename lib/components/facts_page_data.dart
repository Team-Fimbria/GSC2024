    "text": "•  Baby milestones are exciting for caregivers and one that happens fairly early on is that first real smile. \n\n•  It's hard not be delighted when a baby's happiness starts shining through. \n\n•  When does it happen? Babies typically start smiling between 6 and 8 weeks. \n\n•  Keep in mind, premature babies may need a little more time to reach that milestone. \n\n•  By about 6 to 12 weeks, your baby will begin to smile in response to you (social or \"real\" smiles). \n\n•  Until then, sweet-looking grins are automatic reflexive smiles in response to gas and other bodily functions."

    "text": "•  Recommended to wait 24 hours after birth for your newborn's first bath, and not to immerse your newborn in water until the umbilical cord area is completely healed. Before that point, sponge baths should be your go-to cleaning method. \n\n•  Use only sensitivity-tested, baby-specific products in the water and on your baby. \n\n•  Before you place your baby in the tub, check the temperature by dipping your elbow into the water - it should be warm but not too hot. \n\n•  It's important to remember that the skin barrier in babies is still maturing, which makes them more sensitive to irritants and drying out. \n\n•  Dry your baby thoroughly and wrap them in a towel so they retain body heat, ensuring all creases are water-free, before applying any lotion and diapering and dressing."

    "text": "•  Two to four years for a child's skin to undergo the full maturation process, during which infant skin is susceptible to disruption from external factors, such as weather, topical products, and other potential irritants. \n\n•  Use a baby washcloth, gently cleanse the areas that need to be cleansed, such as the diaper area, the folds of skin (armpits), and the feet, and immediately moisturize to help seal in hydration and protect their skin barrier. \n\n•  Diaper rash is one of the most common skin conditions in infants, it is suggested that parents practice frequent diaper changes. \n\n•  Gently clean the diaper area to avoid any extra irritation, and avoid scented baby wipes or wipes that are alcohol-based."

    "text": "•  A catnap is usually a nap that lasts between 20-45 minutes or less. Generally, catnapping babies are unable to re-settle after these short naps, meaning they can't put sleep cycles together for a deep, restorative sleep. \n\n•  Timing is critical. Tuning into your baby's natural biological rhythms ensures that when they're placed in their crib, melatonin (the powerful sleep hormone) is elevated in their system, and their brain and body will be primed to drift off with little fuss.  \n\n•  When your little one is still, quiet, disinterested in their surroundings, and staring off into space, melatonin is peaking in their system and it's time to go to bed. \n\n•  To avoid catnapping: \n   1.  Set your baby up for success with the perfect sleep environment - a dark room, white noise and swaddle/sleeping bag.  \n\n    2.  Make sure your baby has a full belly and is well-winded before naps so they don't wake hungry or uncomfortable. \n\n    3.  Follow the age-appropriate awake times in our Little Ones App to ensure your baby is perfectly ready for sleep at nap times."

    "text": "•  It is normal for baby to be a screamer when crying. \n\n•  Rock your baby in a carrier while repeatedly shooshing in their ear, you can even try soothing songs and rythms. \n\n•  There are different cries normally a baby makes: \n   1.  Hunger Cries: \n     - Sounds Like: Fairly desperate and unrelenting; usually high pitched. \n     - Solution: When in doubt, assume your baby is crying because they're hungry and offer them a bottle or the breast. But don't feed bottle-fed babies too soon after their last meal \n\n   2.  Tired Cries: \n     - Sounds Like: Breathy, helpless. This cry can be intermittent and is more easily soothed than others. \n     - Solution: Try swaddling your baby to help them sleep better. \n\n   3.  Cries from Boredom or Overstimulation: \n     - Sounds Like: Usually not as loud as other cries, and often staccato. Boredom can easily transition to laughter; overstimulation can escalate to shrieking. \n     - Solution: In the case of a bored baby, delay your response by a few seconds or a minute. If your baby is overstimulated, try calming them with comforting noises, such as a white noise machine, vacuum cleaner, or whirring fan. \n\n   4.  Cries from Annoyance or Discomfort: \n     - Sounds Like: Forced and whiny; has a pattern of short repetitions, like \"uh-UH, uh-UH.\" \n     - Solution: Look for causes, whether it's a scratchy hat or irritating noise, and remedy the situation. Also consider that your infant might be cold, even if they're indoors. Your best defense is to dress them in layers. \n\n   5.  Cries from Pain: \n     - Sounds Like: Piercing and grating. \n     - Solution: The sucking reflex calms a baby, so consider giving them a pacifier or letting them breastfeed. Pacifiers help babies pass gas through their systems, but she notes that bottle-fed babies take to them better. \n\n   6.  Colic Cries: \n     - Sounds Like: High-pitched, screechy, and inconsolable. \n     - Solution: Try Five S's, i.e. Swaddle, Side/Stomach, Shushing, Swinging, and Sucking."
