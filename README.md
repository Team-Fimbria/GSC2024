## Problem Statemnet
New mothers often worry about their own physical recuperation, which includes managing pain and suffering following the delivery and recovering from childbirth. They might have breastfeeding-related worries regarding nipple discomfort, latch problems, and milk production. Major issues include establishing a balance between self-care and childcare, sleep deprivation, and adjusting to the demands of caring for a newborn. Anxiety, overwhelm, and mood swings can all be caused by hormonal fluctuations. Women could be concerned about getting back to their pre-pregnancy weight and their body image. Creating a network of support and asking family, friends, and medical professionals for assistance are crucial for managing these worries.
